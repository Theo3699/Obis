					Obesity is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more. BMI is
                    a calculation that takes a person’s weight and height into account. However, BMI does have some
                    limitations.

                    According to the CDC,“Factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, and muscle mass can influence the
                    relationship between BMI and
                    body fat. Also, BMI doesn’t distinguish between excess fat, muscle, or bone mass, nor does it
                    provide
                    any indication of the distribution of fat among individuals.”

                	Eating more calories than you burn in daily activity and exercise (on a
                    long-term basis) causes obesity. Over time, these extra calories add up and cause you to gain
                    weight.
                    Common specific causes of obesity include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>eating a poor diet of foods high in fats and calories</li>
                        <li>having a sedentary (inactive) lifestyle</li>
                        <li>not sleeping enough, which can lead to hormonal changes that make you feel hungrier and
                            crave certain high-calorie foods</li>
                        <li>genetics, which can affect how your body processes food into energy and how fat is stored
                            growing older, which can lead to less muscle mass and a slower metabolic rate, making it
                            easier
                            to gain weight</li>
                        <li>pregnancy (weight gained during pregnancy can be difficult to lose and may eventually lead
                            to
                            obesity)</li>
                    </ul>
